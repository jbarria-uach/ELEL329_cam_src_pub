# USB camera video publisher ROS Package

This package contains just a ROS launch file intended to be called from a Raspberry Pi 3B.

It creates a new *usb_cam* node with specific parameters in the context of an assignment corresponding to the master's course *ELEL329* at Universidad Austral de Chile.

The idea is to send these video frames using ROS to feed a [custom video processing node](https://github.com/jbarria-uach/ELEL329_image_inverter)
